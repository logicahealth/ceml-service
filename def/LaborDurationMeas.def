LaborDurationMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the LaborDurationMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's labor duration measure?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Labor duration measure" by definition means "The amount of time from the beginning to the end of labor".
