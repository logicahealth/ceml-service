FluctuatingMentalStatusAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
In the FluctuatingMentalStatusAssert model, data is a code for Fluctuating Mental Status which means the patient has had an actue change in his/her mental status, not necessarily from a baseline.

Is is the answer to the question "Did the patient’s mental status fluctuate during the past 24hrs as evidenced by fluctuation on a sedation scale (e.g. RASS), GCS, or previous delirium assessment?"
