FunctionalDifficultyEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the FunctionalDifficultyEval model, the question is "what is the subject's functional difficulty?" and the coded answers can be "Extreme", "Not At All", "Somewhat", and "Very" etc.
"Functional difficulty" by definition means "A roadblock to a patient's ability to function normally".
