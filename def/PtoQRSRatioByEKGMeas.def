PtoQRSRatioByEKGMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the PtoQRSRatioByEKGMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's P to QRS Ratio By EKG?" and the answer will be a ratio. 
"PtoQRSRatioByEKGMeas" measures the ratio of the P waves to the QRS complexes on an EKG.
