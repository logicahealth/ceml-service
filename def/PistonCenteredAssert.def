PistonCenteredAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the PistonCenteredAssert model, data is PistonCentered_ECID which means to ensure the piston is in a centered position on the ventilation device.
