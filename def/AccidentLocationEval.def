AccidentLocationEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the AccidentLocationEval model, the question is "where did the patient's accident occur?" and the coded answers can be 'home','school', and 'work' etc.
