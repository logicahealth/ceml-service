TriggerFlowSensitivitySettingMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric
value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the
"answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the TriggerFlowSensitivitySettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Trigger Flow Sensitivity Setting?" and the numeric answer
will have a unit of measure. 
"TriggerFlowSensitivitySettingMeas" by definition means the threshold (in liters per minute) at which the ventilator is set to assist the patient.
