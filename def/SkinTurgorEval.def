SkinTurgorEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the SkinTurgorEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Skin Turgor?" and the coded answers can be 'Tenting', 'Poor turgor', and 'Normal turgor'.
"SkinTurgorEval" by definition means the patient's skin's ability to return to normal position after being pinched and pulled up.
