CalculatedControlledRespiratoryRateMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the CalculatedControlledRespiratoryRateMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's calculated controlled respiratory rate while on a mechanical ventilator?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
The patient's total respiratory rate minus the assisted respiratory rate given to the patient by a ventilator.
