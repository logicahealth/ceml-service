HighInspiredTidalVolumeAlarmSettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the HighInspiredTidalVolumeAlarmSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's high inspired tidal volume alarm setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"High inspired tidal volume alarm setting" by definitions means "The High Inspired Tidal Volume alarm setting sets the amount of inspired gas volume sensed by the ventilator that will sound the High Inspired Volume Alarm.  The alarm will sound if the inspired volume is greater than the setting".
