EmployeeExternalId is a component model that restricts the ExternalId model (i.e., "constrains" the ExternalId model) data to EmployeeExternalId_KEY_ECID (II). 
By definition EmployeeExternalId means the external identifier for the employee.  Normally the ID is identified in an incoming message and thereafter stored in the receiver system.
