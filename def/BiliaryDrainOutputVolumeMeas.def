BiliaryDrainOutputVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BiliaryDrainOutputVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's amount of output from a biliary drain?" and the numeric answer will be expressed in mililiters. 
"BiliaryDrainOutputVolume" by definition means "teh volume of Biliary Drain Output fluid from a drain placed into the gall bladder.".
