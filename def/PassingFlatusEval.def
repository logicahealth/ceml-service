PassingFlatusEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the PassingFlatusEval model, the question is, "Is the patient exhibiting a bowel movement as flatulence?" Yes, no and unknown are the answers.
"PassingFlatusEval" by definition means an evaluation to determine if the patient is exhibiting a bowel movement as flatulence.
