TubingCompressionFactorMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value 
(PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the 
"answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the TubingCompressionFactorMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Tubing Compression Factor?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"TubingCompressionFactorMeas" by definition represents each mL of gas that is retained within the tubing circuitry for each cmH20 of circuit 
pressure.
