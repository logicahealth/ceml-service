DepthOfNeuromuscularBlockadeTrainOfFourMeas captures the number of successive electrical impulses that elicit a twitch reaction in a patient 
currently using a neuromuscular blocking agent.  The scale ranges from zero to four twitches observed out of four successive 
impulses received. The value is used to assess effectiveness of neuromuscular blocking agents on ventilated patients.

Model renamed to reflect original intent of the mode, which wasl to capture depth of blockade using Train of Four method.  Other methods are different enough that 
this couldn't be accomplished using the method qualifier.

preParalyticCurrentLevelMeas is intended to hold the current required to elicit the expected response before the paralytics were administered, ie. the baseline current.
