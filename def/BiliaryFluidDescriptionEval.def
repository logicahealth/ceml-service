BiliaryFluidDescriptionEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White". In the BiliaryFluidDescriptionEval model, the question is "what are the subject's biliary drain output fluid characteristics ?" and the coded answers can be 'yellow','bloody', and 'black' etc.
