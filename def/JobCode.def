JobCode will capture the code to classify the kind of work performed by an employee.  Usually it is an employer-defined categorization of work. This value is used primarily for payroll/renumeration purposes and is not necessarily indicative of an employee's specific work assignments, responsibilities and privileges. Example values include accountant, programmer analyst, patient care associate, staff nurse.
