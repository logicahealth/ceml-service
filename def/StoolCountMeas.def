StoolCountMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the StoolCountMeas model, the question is "how many stools has the patient made?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"StoolCountMeas" by definition means the number assigned to the patient stool. A bit ambigious, but allows for tracking weather this is stool 1 or stool 2 or stool 3, and so on. 

Time is a valueSet with time frames such as per  24 hours, per 8 hours and per 12 hours.
