BurnEstimatedOutputFluidDescriptionEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the BurnEstimatedOutputFluidDescriptionEval model, the question is "what is the description of a subject's fluid output from a burn?" and the coded answers can be 'black','clots', and 'pink' etc.
BurnEstimatedOutputFluidDescriptionEval is the evaluation model to describe estimated output fluid characteristics during the initial stages of a burn injury.
