CervicalEffacementMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the CervicalEffacementMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's cervix percent of effacement?" and the numeric answer will be expressed in a percentage. 
CervicalEffacementMeas is a model to assess the percentage of cervix effaced, or stretched,
during labor.
