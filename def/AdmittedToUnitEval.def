AdmittedToUnitEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the AdmittedToUnitEval model, the question is "What is the subject's unit and room number they were admitted to?" and the coded answers can be 'STICU room 1' etc.
