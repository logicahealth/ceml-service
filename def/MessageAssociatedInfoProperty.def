MessageAssociatedInfoProperty
This is the MessageAssociatedInfoProperty CEM. 
			name value pairs of data to be substituted into messageText.
			e.g., in the messageText "Patient has HIGH {} ({})", the MessageAssociatedProperties might be:
			indexNumber = 1
			value = "Potassium Lab" (CS)
			indexNumber = 2
			value = "4.5 mEq/L" (PQ)
			
			A MessageAssociatedInfoProperty is a Property with an "indexNumber" qualifier.	
			
			There are five wrapper data items in the model, only one is selected to be used when a MessageAssociatedInfoProperty is 
			instantiated. So the program needs to loop through all the five items and check the one that is not null to find the actual data.
