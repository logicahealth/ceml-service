LeftPulmonaryArteryPressureMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data.

In the LeftPulmonaryArteryPressureMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's left pulmonary artery pressure?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Left pulmonary artery pressure" by definitions means "A measure of the blood pressure found in the left branch of the pulmonary artery".
