DifficultySwallowingAssert is based on SNOMED SCTID: 288939007. In SNOMED, dysphagia(disorder) is different than difficulty swallowing(finding).
In this SNOMED domain are the specific items that are difficult to swallow:

Difficulty Swallowing (finding) SCTID: 288939007, and descendants
   Difficulty swallowing food
      Difficulty swallowing soft foods
      Difficulty swallowing solids
   Difficulty swallowing fluid
      Difficulty swallowing saliva
      Difficulty swallowing thickened fluid

This model Asserts difficulty swallowing, and uses those values to be more specific.  To this list we will add "difficulty swallowing pills".
