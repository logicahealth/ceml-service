BradenQScoreSensoryPerceptionMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BradenQScoreSensoryPerceptionMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Braden Q sensory perception score?" and the answer will be an ordinal value.
BradenQScoreSensoryPerceptionMeas is an element of the BradenQ score skin assessment tool. This section evaluates a newborn/pediatric patient's ability to respond meaningfully to pressure-related discomfort.
