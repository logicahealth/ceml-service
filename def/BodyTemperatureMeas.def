BodyTemperatureMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BodyTemperatureMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Body Temperature?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
BodyTemperatureMeas captures a subject's measured body temperature. Normal units in this model are degrees celsius.
