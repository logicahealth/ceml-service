DryWeightMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the DryWeightMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's dry weight?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure of kilograms. 
"DryWeight" by definition means weight of a patient usually after a dialysis treatment.
