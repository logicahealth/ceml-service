GeneralNatureOfUnitEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the GeneralNatureOfUnitEval model, the question is "What is the subject's general nature of unit?"  "General nature of unit" means the status of nursing unit activity level. For example, the nursing unit may be
"adequately staffed," "at capacity," and so forth.
