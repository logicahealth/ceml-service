Role is the association between two entities, one who plays the role defined by the other.
Entities play roles and participate in acts.
Roles are consistent across acts, while ParticipationTypes are defined only within the associated act.

For example:
		Registered Nurse is the role played by a person.  The role is defined by a licensing entity.
		A registered nurse can participate in acts as Observer, Performer, Reporter, etc.
