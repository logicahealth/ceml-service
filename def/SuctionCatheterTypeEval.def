SuctionCatheterTypeEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value
(CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?",
and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the SuctionCatheterTypeEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Suction Catheter Type?" and the coded answers
can be 'Bulb suction device', 'Closed suction catheter', etc.
"SuctionCatheterTypeEval" by definition means the type of catheter used for airway clearance of secretions.
