EventOfInterest is a component model. This model holds a "question" in the code and holds a coded value (CD) "answer" from the value set referred to in data.
In the EventOfInterest model the question is "what is the event of interest?" and the coded answers from the EventOfInterest value set can be "Preoperative," or "Postoperative."
EventOfInterest by definition means a user defined event used as a reference point for an order duration (a patient related event to which a frequency of action can be anchored).
