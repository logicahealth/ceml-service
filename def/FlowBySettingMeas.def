FlowBySettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the FlowBySettingMeas model,  the question is "what is the subject's flow by setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Flow by setting" by definitions means "Gas flow made available for a spontaneously breathing patient".
