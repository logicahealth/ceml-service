CerebralPerfusionPressureMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the CerebralPerfusionPressureMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's cerebral perfusion pressure?" and the numeric answer will be expressed in milimeters of mercury (mmHg)
Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) measures the pressure of blood located in the cerebrum (brain) and indicates
 the adequacy of blood supply to the brain.
