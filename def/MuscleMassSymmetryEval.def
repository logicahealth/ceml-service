MuscleMassSymmetryEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the MuscleMassSymmetryEval model, the question is "what is the subject's muscle mass symmetry?".
"Muscle mass symmetry" by definition means "Where the patient's underlying structure of the muscle is symmetrical".
