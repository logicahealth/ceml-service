TerminationSensitivitySettingMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key
and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is
"What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the TerminationSensitivitySettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Termination Sensitivity Setting?"
and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"TerminationSensitivitySettingMeas" by definition means a ventilator setting that regulates air flow stoppage when pressures
are measured within a specific percent of the Peak Inspirator Pressure, from 5% to 25%, in 5% increments.
