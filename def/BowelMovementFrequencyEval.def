StoolFrequencyPatternEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the StoolFrequencyPatternEval model, the question is, "What is the subject's Stool Frequency Pattern?" and the coded answers can be "twice daily," "after meals," etc.
"StoolFrequencyPatternEval" by definition means the number of times a patient usually has a bowel movement in a certain time frame.
