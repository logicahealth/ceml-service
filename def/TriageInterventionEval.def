TriageInterventionEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the TriageInterventionEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Triage Intervention?" and the coded answers can be any procedure.
"TriageInterventionEval" by definition means all or any intervention type of procedure done during triage.
