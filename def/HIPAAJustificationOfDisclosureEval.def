HIPAAJustificationOfDisclosureEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the HIPAAJustificationOfDisclosureEval model, the question is "what is the subject's HIPAA justification of disclosure?" and the coded answers can be "Court order", "Justification, NOS", and "State or Federal law or regulation" etc.
"HIPAA justification of disclosure" by definition means "The acceptable reason for disclosing HIPAA information".
