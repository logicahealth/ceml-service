ExacerbatingFactor model is a component model. This model holds a "question" in the code and holds a coded value (CD) "answer" from the value set referred to in data. 
For example, in the ExacerbatingFactor model the question is "What is the exacerbating factor?" and the coded answer from the ExacerbatingFactor VALUESET set can be  "activity," etc.
ExacerbatingFactor by definition means an action, object, or something that makes a condition or problem worse.
