AssistedRespiratoryRateMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the AssistedRespiratoryRateMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's rate of assisted ventilatory breaths?" and the numeric answer will expressed in breaths per minute. 
"AssistedRespiratoryRate" by definition means "breaths given to a subject by a mechanical ventilator".
 
The number of breaths per minute the patient received with assistance of the ventilator.
