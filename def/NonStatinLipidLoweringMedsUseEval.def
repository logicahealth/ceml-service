NonStatinLipidLoweringMedsUseEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the NonStatinLipidLoweringMedsUseEval model, the question is "what is the subject's non-statin lipid-lowering meds use?" and the coded answers can be "niacin," "fibrates," etc.
"Non statin lipid lowering meds use" by definition means "Non statins have been used to lower lipid levels".
