ExpiratoryTimeSettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer"" in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm."
In the ExpiratoryTimeSettingMeas model the question is "What is the Expiratory Time Setting?" and the "answer" in data can be "X L/min."
ExpiratoryTimeSetting by definition means the ventilator time setting for allowed breath expiration. This setting typically sets the rate in a time-cycled ventilator.  This setting may be labeled "rate" on some ventilators, such as the Draeger transport ventilators.
