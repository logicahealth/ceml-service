BronchiolitisScoreWheezeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BronchiolitisScoreWheezeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's bronchiolitis wheeze score?" and the answer will be an ordinal value.
BronchiolitisScoreWheezeMeas is model of the element of the bronchiolitis score used to assess severity bronchial wheezing in a newborn or pediatric patient.
Values range from 0-3 and correspond as follows:  '0' corresponds to no wheezing or 'none', '1' corresponds to wheezing upon expiration only, '2' to wheezing upon inspiration and expiration, and a '3' to diminished breath sounds.
