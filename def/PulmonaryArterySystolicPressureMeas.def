PulmonaryArterySystolicPressureMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the PulmonaryArterySystolicPressureMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"PulmonaryArterySystolicPressureMeas" is a subject's systolic blood pressure measured in the pulmonary artery.
