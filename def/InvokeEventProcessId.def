InvokeEventProcessId is the invoke event process ID, a unique identifier that starts the alert by data 
drive or time drive triggering events. One invoke event can ripple into multiple alert event processes. Technically one 
InvokeEventProcessId has one-to-many relationship to AlertEventProcessId. This InvokeEventProcessId links to many rules that are 
applicable to this event.  In most cases, no alerts are fired. But when alerts are fired, each alert will be subsequently assigned 
InvokeEventProcessId, which is stored in the alert CEM instance.
