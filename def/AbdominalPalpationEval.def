AbdominalPalpationEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the AbdominalPalpationEval model, the question is "how does the patient's abdomen feel upon palpation?" and the coded answers can be 'soft','firm', and 'rigid' etc.
"AbdominalPalpation" describes findings of location and character noted when a patient's abdomen is
examined using palpation.
