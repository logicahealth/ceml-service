PregnancyStatusEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
 In the PregnancyStatusEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Pregnancy Status?" and the coded answers can be 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Denies', and 'Not pregnant'.
 "PregnancyStatusEval" by definition means whether a subject is pregnant or not. 
Pregnancy status at time of encounter.
