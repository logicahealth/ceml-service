PeripheralVisionEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the PeripheralVisionEval model, the question is evaluating the subject's peripheral vision.
