ObservationAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the ObservationAssert model, data is from values in the ObservationAssertion_VALUESET_ECID.
By definition ObservationAssert is a Non-instantiable base model: and is an assertion that a condition happened to a patient with a clinical intention.
