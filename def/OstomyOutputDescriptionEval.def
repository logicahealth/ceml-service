OstomyOutputDescriptionEval is an evaluation model that restricts (i.e., constrains) the FluidDescriptionEval model to ostomy output-specific fluid description values. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the "OstomyOutputDescriptionEval" model, the question is "what is the description of the ostomy output fluid?" and the coded answers can be 'melena',or 'Clay'.
"Ostomy Output Description" by definition means the description (characteristics) of ostomy output.
