EnuresisAssert 
EnuresisAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition 
being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the EnuresisAssert model, data is Enuresis_ECID which means involuntary urination, especially at night.
