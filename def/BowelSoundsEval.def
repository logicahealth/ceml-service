BowelSoundsEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the BowelSoundsEval model, the question is "what is the quality of the subject's bowel sounds?" and the coded answers can be 'active','hypoactive', and 'hyperactive' etc.
"BowelSounds" by definition means "the sounds the gastrointestinal tract normally makes".
