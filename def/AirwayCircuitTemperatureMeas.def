AirwayCircuitTemperatureMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the AirwayCircuitTemperatureMeas model, the question is "what is the temperature in the ventilator's airway circuit'?" and the numeric answer will have a value experessed in degrees celsius. 
"Airway Circuit Temperature" by definition means "the temperature of the environment contained in the circuit connection tubing of a mechanical ventilator to an artificial gas source and patient".
