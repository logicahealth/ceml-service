QTIntervalByEKGMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the QTIntervalByEKGMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's QT Interval By EKG?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"QTIntervalByEKGMeas" measures the duration of the QT interval on an EKG.  It is equivalent to LOINC QTIntervalTimePatientHeartEkg.
