CalculatedMinuteVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the CalculatedMinuteVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's calculated minute volume?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
Calculated minute volume by definition means the total volume of gas, usually oxygen, delivered in one minute during respiration..
