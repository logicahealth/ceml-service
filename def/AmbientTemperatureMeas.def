AmbientTemperatureMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the  AmbientTemperatureMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's  Ambient Temperature?" and the numeric answer will be expressed in degrees celsius. 
"Ambient Temperature" by definition means "the temperature of the patient's environment".
