HeartRateMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer" in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm."
In the HeartRateMeas model, the question is "What is the subject's heart rate?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Heart rate" by definition means "The speed at which the heart is beating."
