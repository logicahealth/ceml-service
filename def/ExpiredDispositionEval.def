ExpiredDispositionEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) "answer" in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?" and the "answer" in data can be "White."
  In the ExpiredDispositionEval model the question is "What is the expiration disposition?" and the coded answers can be "dead on arrival" (DOA) or "expired post arrival."
ExpiredDisposition by definition means the expiration disposition of the subject.
