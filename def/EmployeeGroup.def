EmployeeGroup is a component model.
The EmployeeGroup model captures the data from the key domain of EmployeeGroup_KEY_VALUESET_ECID in the form of a coded value (CD) answer from the value set referred to in data.
For example, in the EmploymentAssignmentGroup model the question is "what is the Employment Assignment Group?" and the coded answers from the Employee SubGroup value set can be "Human Resource User," "Non HR/Payroll User," "Payroll user" or "Human Resource Payroll User."
EmployeeGroup by definition means an employer-defined categorization of employees, for example, HR/Payroll employee group, etc.
