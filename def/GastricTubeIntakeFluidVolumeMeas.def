GastricTubeIntakeFluidVolumeMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the GastricTubeIntakeFluidVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's gastric tube intake volume?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Gastric tube intake volume" by definitions means "Volume of intake through gastrostomy tube".
