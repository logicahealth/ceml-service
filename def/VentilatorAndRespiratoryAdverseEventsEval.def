VentilatorAndRespiratoryAdverseEventsEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value
(CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer"
in data can be "White".
In the VentilatorAndRespiratoryAdverseEventsEval model, the question is, "What caused the subject's ventilator or respiratory adverse event?"
and the coded answers can be "ventilator disconnect," "mucous plug," etc.
"VentilatorAndRespiratoryAdverseEventsEval" by definition means complications related to respiratory procedures and mechanical ventilation.
