BowelEliminationDescriptionEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the BowelEliminationDescriptionEval model, the question is, "How is the Bowel Elimination described?"
"BowelEliminationDescriptionEval" by definition is the description of the bowel eliminaition of the patient.
For example, 'stooling, no difficulties', 'not stooling', 'stooling with difficulties.'
