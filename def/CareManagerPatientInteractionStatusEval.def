CareManagerPatientInteractionStatusEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the CareManagerPatientInteractionStatusEval model, the question is "what is the status of the interaction between the subject and a care manager?" and the coded answers can be 'Patient/Family participating with care manager','Patient/Family participating with educator', and 'closed' etc.
