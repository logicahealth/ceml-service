UterineContractionPerHourFrequencyMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds
a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?",
and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the UterineContractionPerHourFrequencyMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Uterine Contraction Per Hour Frequency?"
and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"UterineContractionPerHourFrequencyMeas" by definition means how many uterine contractions occur in a one hour time period.
