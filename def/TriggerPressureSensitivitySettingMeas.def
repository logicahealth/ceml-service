TriggerPressureSensitivitySettingMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a 
numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?",
and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the TriggerPressureSensitivitySettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Trigger Pressure Sensitivity Setting?" and the numeric
answer will have a unit of measure. 
"TriggerPressureSensitivitySettingMeas" by definition means the threshold (in cmH2O) at which the ventilator is set to assist the patient.
