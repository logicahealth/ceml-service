ConditionPresenceProbablity is an iso-semantic clinical element model and is used to record the degree of certainty to which a condition exists in an individual.  
The data value could be as simple as present, absent, and maybe, or as complex as present, absent, probably prsent, probably not present, not likely, high probablility, low probability, etc.
This model is iso-semantic to models that assert that a specific condition is present and also provide other qualifying data such as start date, abatement date, body location, severity, course, stage, etc.
