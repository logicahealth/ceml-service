TransportationModeEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value
(CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and
the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the TransportationModeEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Transportation Mode?" and the coded answers can be
'Ambulatory', 'Carried', 'Wheelchair', etc.
"TransportationModeEval" by definition means how the subject is being transported.
