DischargeDiagnosisEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the DischargeDiagnosisEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Discharge Diagnosis?" and the coded answers can be "Pancreatitis", and "Suicide attempt" etc.
"Discharge Diagnosis" by definition means "the diagnosis given to a subject at the time they are dismissed from medical care".
