StoolVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the StoolVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Stool Volume?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"StoolVolumeMeas" by definition means the volume of stool output (can include estimated or stated amounts).
