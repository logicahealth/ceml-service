DSVNIDistressScaleBehavioralTotalScoreMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the DSVNIDistressScaleBehavioralTotalScoreMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's DSVNI Distress Scale Behavioral Total Score?" and the numeric answer will have coded ordinal value. 
DSVNIDistressScaleBehavioralScoreTotalMeas is the total DSVNI distress scale score used mainly with ventilated newborns, but can be used with a non-ventilated newborn to rate pain/discomfort.
