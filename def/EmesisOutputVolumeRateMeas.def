EmesisOutputVolumeRateMeas is a measurement model that restricts the "OutputVolumeRateMeas" model (i.e., this model "constrains" the qualifiers in the OutputVolumeRateMeas" model to emesis output-specific sources, body locations, and methods and devices). A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. 
For example, in the "EmesisOutputVolumeRateMeas" model the "question" or the "test" is "What is the measured Emesis Output Volume Rate per time period?" and the "answer" in data can be "X mL".
By definition EmesisOutputVolumeRateMeas means the measurement of the rate and volume of emesis output over a period of time.
