DailyDoseCount is the number of doses of a substance given daily, and data type is integer. For example, if TID is the CodedFrequency, then the daily dose count is 3. 
This is set by the CEM Orders Service from data stored with the CodedFrequency definitions. The purpose is to support 
decision support activities. If this is based on a variable frequency, it is the maximum expected doses in a 24-hour period.
