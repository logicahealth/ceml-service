ApgarScoreTenMinuteTotalMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm"
In the ApgarScoreTenMinuteTotalMeas model, the question is "what is the newborn's Total Apgar score 1o minutes after birth?" and the numeric answer will be PQ refecting the total of the ordinal values captured in the ApgarScoreTenMinuteActivityMeas, ApgarScoreTenMinuteAppearanceMeas, ApgarScoreTenMinuteGrimaceMeas, ApgarScoreTenMinutePulseMeas, ApgarScoreTenMinuteRespirationMeas models. Values can range from 0-10.  
ApgarScoreTenMinuteTotalMeas captures a newborn's total Apgar score which assesses the newborn's respiratory, cardiac, musculoskeletal, and neurological status 10 minutes after the time of birth.
