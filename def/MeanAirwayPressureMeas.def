MeanAirwayPressureMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the MeanAirwayPressureMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's mean airway pressure?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Mean airway pressure" by definition means "This is the average pressure in the ventilator circuit".
