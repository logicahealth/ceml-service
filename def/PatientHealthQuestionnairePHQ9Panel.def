The PHQ-9 is a diagnostic tool that is specific to depression. The PHQ contains modules on 12 different mental health disorders including mood, anxiety, and some of the sleep disorder modules. This tool assesses the 15 most common physical symptoms in primary care. A shorter, alternative version of the PHQ, called the Brief PHQ, assesses depression, anxiety, psychological stressors, and women's reproductive health. This scale simply scores each of the 9 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria based on the mood module from the original PRIME-MD.
