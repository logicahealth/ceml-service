HygieneProvidedEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the HygieneProvidedEval model, the question is, "What form of hygiene has been provided?"
"HygieneProvidedEval" by definition is the statement of what form of hygiene has been provided, if any, to a person (typically a patient).
Thy types of hygiene can be things like  'shampoo,' 'shave,' 'back rub.'
