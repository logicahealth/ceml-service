EnteralTubeIntakeFluidVolumeMeas is a measurement model that restricts the "IntakeFluidVolumeMeas" model (i.e., this model "constrains" the qualifiers in the IntakeFluidVolumeMeas" model to eneteral fluid intake-specific body locations, methods and devices and fluid types). A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer" in data. 
For example, in the EnteralTubeIntakeFluidVolumeMeas model the "question" or the "test" is "What is the Enteral Tube Intake Fluid Volume?" and the "answer" in data can be "X mL."
By definition EnteralTubeIntakeFluidVolumeMeas means the measurement of the volume of enteral tube fluid intake.

06/21/2016 in discussion it was decided that the constraint on intakeFluidType caused too much confusion. Thus, we simplified the definition of intakeFluidType
