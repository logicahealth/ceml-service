BodyMassIndexMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BodyMassIndexMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Body Mass Index" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
Body mass index is calculated using the height and weight of an individual.
