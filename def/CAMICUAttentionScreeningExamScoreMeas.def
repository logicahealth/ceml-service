AttentionScreeningExam_aseMeas is an qualifer model. It is used to capture the score of the "Attention Screening Exam" (ASE). This is not used elsewhere and the score itslef is not meaningful.
In general, the answer is positive (scores of 8 or more) or negative (scores of less than 3). The number of errors to get a result of negative is zero to two. The number of errors to get a result of postive is 3 to 10.

Current methods for AttentionScreeningExamMethods_VALUESET_CODE include an exam based on Pictures or an exam based on Letters. (See PDD)

Feature 2: Inattention
** Feature 2 is positive if ASE score is less than 8.
Assess using the Attention Screening Examination (ASE) –
Letters or Pictures. Attempt ASE Letters first. If pt is able to
perform this test and the score is clear, record this score and
move to Feature 3. If pt is unable to perform this test or the
score is unclear, perform the ASE Pictures. If you perform
both tests, use the ASE pictures results to score the Feature.
ASE Letters: Auditory/Random Letter “A” Test
Directions: Say to the patient, “I am going to read you a series of 10 letters.
Whenever you hear the letter ‘A,’ indicate by squeezing my hand.” Read
letters from the following letter list in a normal tone.
S A V E A H A A R T
Scoring: Errors are counted when patient fails to squeeze on the letter “A”
and when the patient squeezes on any letter other than “A.”
ASE Pictures: Visual/Picture Recognition
Directions and Scoring are located on the picture packet
