UrinaryIncontinenceOutputFluidVolumeRateMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data.
For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be 
"100 bpm".
In the UrinaryIncontinenceOutputFluidVolumeRateMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Urinary Incontinence Output Fluid Volume Rate?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Urinary Incontinence Output Fluid Volume Rate" by definition means the rate of urine output through involuntary leakage.
