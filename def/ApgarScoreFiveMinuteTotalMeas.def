ApgarScoreFiveMinuteTotalMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm"
In the ApgarScoreFiveMinuteTotalMeas model, the question is "what is the newborn's Total Apgar score 5 minutes after birth?" and the numeric answer will be PQ refecting the total of the ordinal values captured in the ApgarScoreFiveMinuteActivityMeas, ApgarScoreFiveMinuteAppearanceMeas, ApgarScoreFiveMinuteGrimaceMeas, ApgarScoreFiveMinutePulseMeas, ApgarScoreFiveMinuteRespirationMeas models. Values can range from 0-10.  
ApgarScoreFiveMinuteTotalMeas captures a newborn's total Apgar score which assesses the newborn's respiratory, cardiac, musculoskeletal, and neurological status five minutes after the time of birth.
