Also called Level of Cognitive Functioning Scale (LCFS).

An ordinal scale with the following values:

(1) Level I - No Response.
	Patient does not respond to external stimuli and appears asleep.
(2) Level II - Generalized Response.
	Patient reacts to external stimuli in nonspecific, inconsistent, and nonpurposeful manner with
	stereotypic and limited responses.
(3) Level III - Localized Response.
	Patient responds specifically and inconsistently with delays to stimuli, but may follow simple
	commands for motor action.
(4) Level IV - Confused, Agitated Response.
	Patient exhibits bizarre, nonpurposeful, incoherent or inappropriate behaviors, has no shortterm
	recall, attention is short and nonselective.
(5) Level V - Confused, Inappropriate, Nonagitated Response.
	Patient gives random, fragmented, and nonpurposeful responses to complex or unstructured
	stimuli - Simple commands are followed consistently, memory and selective attention are
	impaired, and new information is not retained.
(6) Level VI - Confused, Appropriate Response.
	Patient gives context appropriate, goal-directed responses, dependent upon external input for
	direction. There is carry-over for relearned, but not for new tasks, and recent memory
	problems persist.
(7) Level VII - Automatic, Appropriate Response.
	Patient behaves appropriately in familiar settings, performs daily routines automatically, and
	shows carry-over for new learning at lower than normal rates. Patient initiates social
	interactions, but judgment remains impaired.
(8) Level VIII - Purposeful, Appropriate Response.
	Patient oriented and responds to the environment but abstract reasoning abilities are
	decreased relative to premorbid levels.
