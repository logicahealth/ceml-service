MeanAirwayPressureMinimumAlarmSettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the MeanAirwayPressureMinimumAlarmSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's mean airway pressure minimum alarm setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Mean airway pressure minimum alarm setting" by definition means "An alarm setting sensitive to the minimum limit for mean airway pressure".
