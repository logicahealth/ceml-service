TotalMinuteVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric
value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?",
and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the TotalMinuteVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Total Minute Volume?" and the numeric answer will have a
unit of measure. 
"TotalMinuteVolumeMeas" by definition means the amount of air exhaled from lungs in 60 seconds (expressed as liters/min).
Also called minute ventilation.
