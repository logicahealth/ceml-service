EnemaIntakeFluidVolumeMeas is a measurement model that restricts the IntakeFluidVolumeMeas model (i.e., this model "constrains" the qualifiers in the IntakeFluidVolumeMeas model to enema intake-specific body locations, methods and devices and fluid types). A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer"" in data. 
For example, in the EnemaIntakeFluidVolumeMeas model the "question" or the "test" is "What is the Enema Intake Fluid Volume?" and the "answer" in data can be "X mL."
By definition Enema Intake Fluid Volume means the measurement of the volume of enema intake.
