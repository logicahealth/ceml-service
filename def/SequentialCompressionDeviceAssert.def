SequentialCompressionDeviceAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the SequentialCompressionDeviceAssert model, data is SequentialCompressionDevice_ECID which means that devices designed to limit the development
of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Peripheral Edema by way of compressing the lower extremities are in place on the patient.
