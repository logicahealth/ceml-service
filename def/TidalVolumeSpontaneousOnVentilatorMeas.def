TidalVolumeSpontaneousOnVentilatorMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key
and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is
the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the TidalVolumeSpontaneousOnVentilatorMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's spontaneous Tidal Volume on the Ventilator?"
and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"TidalVolumeSpontaneousOnVentilatorMeas" by definition means the tidal volume of spontaneous respiration from a subject on mechanical
ventilation.  Tidal volume is the normal volume of air displaced between inspiration and expiration when extra effort is not applied.
