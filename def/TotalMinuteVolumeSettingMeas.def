TotalMinuteVolumeSettingMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds
a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart
rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the TotalMinuteVolumeSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Total Minute Volume Setting?" and the numeric
answer will have a unit of measure. 
"TotalMinuteVolumeSettingMeas" by definition means a ventilator setting that regulates the allowed total volume of air the patient
will get per minute.
