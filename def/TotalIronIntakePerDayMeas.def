TotalIronIntakePerDayMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds
a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart
rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the TotalIronIntakePerDayMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Total Iron Intake Per Day?" and the numeric answer
will have a unit of measure. 
"TotalIronIntakePerDayMeas" by definition means a measurement of the total amount of iron taken by the subject per day.
