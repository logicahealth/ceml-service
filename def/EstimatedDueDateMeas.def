EstimatedDueDateMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer" in data. 
For example, in the EstimatedDueDateMeas model the "question" or the "test" is "What is the Estimated Due Date?" and the "answer" in data can be a date.
By definition EsitmatedDueDateMeas means the estimated expected date of confinement (delivery).
