InspiratoryExpiratoryRatioMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the InspiratoryExpiratoryRatioMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's inspiratory expiratory ratio?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Inspiratory expiratory ratio" by definitions means "For a subject on a ventilator it is the actual ratio of the time inspired compared to the time expired (I:E) Ratio, not the ventilator setting".
