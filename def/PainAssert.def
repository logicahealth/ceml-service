PainAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID". In the PainAssert model, data is Pain_ECID which means to assert the patient has pain.
