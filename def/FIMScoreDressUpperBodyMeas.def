For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the FIMScoreDressUpperBodyMeas model,  the question is "what is the subject's FIM score dress upper body?" and the answer will have an ordinal value. 
"FIM score dress upper body" by definitions means "A measurement element that records the FIM score related to a subject's level of independence with dressing their upper body."
