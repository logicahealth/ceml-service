TubeDrainStomaAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the TubeDrainStomaAssert model, data is TubeDrainStomaType_VALUESET_ECID which asserts that a tube, drain, or stoma is in place and describes
the type.
