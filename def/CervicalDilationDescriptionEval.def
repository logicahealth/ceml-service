CervicalDilationDescriptionEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the CervicalDilationDescriptionEval model, the question is "what is the descripton of the subject's cervical dilation?" and the coded answers can be 'dialated','mostly dilated', etc.
CervicalDilationDescriptionEval describes how dilated a cervix is during pregnancy. This 
differs from an exact measurement of the cervix which is addressed in CervicalDilationMeas.
