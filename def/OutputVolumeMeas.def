OutputVolumeMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the "OutputVolumeMeas" model, the question is "what is the subject's Output Volume Measurement?" and the numeric answer will be from a set of values representing output volume associated with specific types of output such as Paracentesis Output, Pericardial Drain, Gastrosotomy Tube etc. and will also have a unit of measure. 
By definition Output Volume Measurement is the base measurement model representing the volume of output (fluid or other).
