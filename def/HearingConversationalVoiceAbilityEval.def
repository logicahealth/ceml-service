HearingConversationalVoiceAbilityEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the HearingConversationalVoiceAbilityEval model, the question is "what is the ability of a patient to hear conversational voice?" and the coded answers can be "audible", "inaudible", and "decreased" etc.
