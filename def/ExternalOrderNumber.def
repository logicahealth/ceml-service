ExternalOrderNumber model is a component model.
The ExternalOrderNumber model captures the data key code of ExternalOrderNumber_KEY_ECID.
By definition the External Order Number is an order number or numbers generated by a non-ECIS system. The purpose is to have a cross map between the OrderNumber and any number of ExternalOrderNumbers. The order number is an associated context. One order may have multiple order numbers. "Context" refers to the particular system that generated the order number. This field goes beyond the HL7 specification for "sender" and "receiver" systems; any number of systems can be applied and directionality is not required.
