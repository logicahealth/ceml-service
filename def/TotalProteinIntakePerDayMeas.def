TotalProteinIntakePerDayMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds
a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart
rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the TotalProteinIntakePerDayMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Total Protein Intake Per Day?" and the numeric
answer will have a unit of measure. 
"TotalProteinIntakePerDayMeas" by definition means a measurement of the amount, in total taken by the subject per day.
