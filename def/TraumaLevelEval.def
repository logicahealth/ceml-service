TraumaLevelEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the TraumaLevelEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Trauma Level?" and the coded answers can be 'life threatening','urgent',
etc.
"TraumaLevelEval" by definition means the urgency level of the patient due to traumatic injury.
