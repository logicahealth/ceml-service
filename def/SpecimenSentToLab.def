SpecimenSentToLab is a Yes/No/Unknown model which is used to state weather a specimen of the assoicted type has been sent.
For example, StoolAssesmentPanel uses this componenent to record that a stool sample has been sent. Note: one could make a StoolSpecimenSentToLab model instead.
Important: as it is, this component does not indicate a lab order was made. SpecimenSentToLab is just a very basic statement that a lab was sent.

Note: not connected to the lab order. could be through a semantic link
//    link SpecimenSentToLabOrderLink links not allowed in Components
//         id labOrderForSpecimen
//         card 0-1

//semantic link could be used to connect this to an OrderLab instance
