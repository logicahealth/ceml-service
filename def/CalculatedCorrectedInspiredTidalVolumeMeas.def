CalculatedCorrectedInspiredTidalVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the CalculatedCorrectedInspiredTidalVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's calculated corrected inspired total volume while on a mechanical ventilator?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
Inspired tidal volume corrected for the compressible gas volume used in mechanical ventilation.
