InfantFeedingTypeEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the InfantFeedingTypeEval model, the question is "what is the subject's infant feeding type?" and the coded answers can be "Bottle feed: no formula preference/undecided", "Breast Feed", "Breast feeding offered and declined", and "Enfamil" etc.
"Infant feeding type" by definition means "The kind of feeding an infant is getting".
