ComputedTomographyPulmonaryAngiogramInterpretation is a model used to store a qualitative description of a Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA). For example, a clinician or natural language processing system analyzes the 
CTPA report and interprets that report rating it as positive or negative.
This model was made specifically for the Homer Warner center for use in the pulomonary embolism (PE) clinical decision support application.
