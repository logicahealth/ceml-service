EdemaScaleMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the "EdemaScaleMeas" model the question is "what is the Edema Scale Measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be a numeric quantity representing the edema scale measurement.
By definition Edema Scale Measurement means measuring edema by a scale used to measure the severity of a patient's edema. Examples may include 1+, 2+, 3+, etc.
