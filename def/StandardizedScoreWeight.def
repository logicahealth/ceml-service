StandardizedScoreWeight is a model used to store the weight given to a value in a standardized score used in decision support. For example, in 
Glasgow Coma Score Motor section, a patient gets a score of 5 if they localize to pain. This would hold the score of 5.
This model was made specifically for the Homer Warner center for use in the pulomonary embolism (PE) clinical decision support application.
