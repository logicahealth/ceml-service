QRSIntervalConsistencyEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the QRSIntervalConsistencyEval model, the question is "What's the consistency of the patient's QRS Interval?" and the coded answers can be 'consistent', and 'inconsistent' etc.
