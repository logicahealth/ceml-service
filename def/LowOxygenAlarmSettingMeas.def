LowOxygenAlarmSettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the LowOxygenAlarmSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's low oxygen alarm setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Low oxygen alarm setting" by definitions means "A Ventilator Alarm setting sensitive to undesirable decrease in 02".
