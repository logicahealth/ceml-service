CerebrospinalFluidDescriptionEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the CerebrospinalFluidDescriptionEval model, the question is "what is the description of the subject's cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)?" and the coded answers can be 'straw','normal', and 'pale yellow' etc.
