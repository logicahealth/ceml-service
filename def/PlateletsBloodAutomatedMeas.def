PlateletsBloodAutomatedMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the PlateletsBloodAutomatedMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's automated platelet count?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"PlateletsBloodAutomatedMeas" by definition means the measurement of platelets in the subject's blood via an analyzer.
