LowPositiveEndExpiratoryPressureAlarmSettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the LowPositiveEndExpiratoryPressureAlarmSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's low positive end expiratory pressure alarm setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Low positive end expiratory pressure alarm setting" by definitions means "An alarm setting sensitive to undesirably low levels of positive end expiratory pressure".
