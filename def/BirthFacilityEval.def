BirthFacilityEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the BirthFacilityEval model, the question is "what is the name of the facility where the subject was born?" and the coded answers can be values from an enterprise's internal location file.
