PatientReintubatedExpediencyEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the PatientReintubatedExpediencyEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Patient Reintubated Expediency?" and the coded answers can be 'Emergent' and 'Elective'.
"PatientReintubatedExpediencyEval" is an evaluation of the condition under which a patient's repeat insertion of an artificial airway device takes place.
