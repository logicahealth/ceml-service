VentricularRateByEKGMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value
(PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the
"answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the VentricularRateByEKGMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Ventricular Rate By EKG?" and the numeric answer will have a unit
of measure. 
"VentricularRateByEKGMeas" by definition means the rate of ventricular contraction as measured on an EKG (using the distance between R waves).
