AirwayLavageAmountMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the AirwayLavageAmountMeas model, the question is "How much saline was instilled in a subject's airway'?" and the numeric answer will have a value expressed in milliliters. 
"AirwayLavageAmount" by definition means "the amount of normal saline used in irrigation/lavage for airway care".
