MaximumCumulativeDose captures a maximum dose per day to represent medication order instructions such as, 
"Take a Maximum of 10 mg/day," or "Maximum of 10 mg," (day implied).  This is different from ordered dose upper limit 
because ordered dose upper limit describes the maximum that can be given in a single dose, whereas this describes a 
total taken per day, and is a total of multiple doses. Maximum lifetime doses must be handled through decision support or 
other means where the information is available.
