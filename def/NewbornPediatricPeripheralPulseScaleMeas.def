NewbornPediatricPeripheralPulseScaleMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the NewbornPediatricPeripheralPulseScaleMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's newborn pediatric peripheral pulse scale?" and the answer will have an ordinal value. 
"Newborn pediatric peripheral pulse scale" by definition means "The scale which is used to measure the strength of peripheral pulse in newborn or pediatric patients".
