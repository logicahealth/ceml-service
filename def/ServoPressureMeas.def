ServoPressureMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the ServoPressureMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Servo Pressure?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"ServoPressureMeas" by definition is the automatically controlled driving pressure in high frequency ventilation which changes as the subjects lung volume changes.  These changes give early warning to changes in patient's lung condition.
