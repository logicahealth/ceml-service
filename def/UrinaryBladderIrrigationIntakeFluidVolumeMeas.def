UrinaryBladderIrrigationIntakeFluidVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds 
a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", 
and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the UrinaryBladderIrrigationIntakeFluidVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Urinary Bladder Irrigation Intake Fluid Volume?" 
and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"UrinaryBladderIrrigationIntakeFluidVolumeMeas" by definition means the volume of fluid taken in during a urinary irrigation procedure.
