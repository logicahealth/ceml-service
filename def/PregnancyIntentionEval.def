PregnancyIntention is a model of a question found on instruments such as the Family Planning Annual Report (FPAR).
e.g. Clinician asks "Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?" of patients.
 
The value set has values such as "Yes, I want to become pregnant," "No I don't want to become pregnant," "I'm OK either way," abd "I'm unsure."
