RespiratoryRateHighAlarmSettingMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the RespiratoryRateHighAlarmSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the Respiratory Rate High Alarm Setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"RespiratoryRateHighAlarmSettingMeas" by definition is a ventilator setting at which, if the respiratory rate is equal to or higher than, will trigger the alarm to sound.
