WeeksToReturnOfficeVisitMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value
(PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the
"answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the WeeksToReturnOfficeVisitMeas model, the question is "how many weeks after the initial visit should the patient come back?" and the numeric
answer will have a unit of measure. 
"WeeksToReturnOfficeVisitMeas" by definition means the number of weeks after an initial or subsequent office visit at which a patient is requested
to return for another visit.
