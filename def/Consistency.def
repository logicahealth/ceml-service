Consistency model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the Consistency model, the question is "what is the substance's consistency?" and the coded answers can be "thin," "dense," "supple," etc.
Consistency describes the texture or feel of a substance.
