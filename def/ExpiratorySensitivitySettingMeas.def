ExpiratorySensitivitySettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer"" in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm."
In the ExpiratorySensitivitySettingMeas model the question is "What is the expiratory sensitivity setting?" and the "answer" in data can be "X L/min."
Expiratory Sensitivity Setting by definition means the ventilator setting of "expiratory sensitivity," which defines the percentage of projected peak inspiratory flow at which the ventilator cycles from inspiration to expiration.
