MentalStatusDiffersFromBaselineAssert is a clinical assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the MentalStatusDiffersFromBaselineAssert model, data is "MentalStatusDiffersFromBaseline_NCID" which means "The subject's mental status has changed from their own baseline".
