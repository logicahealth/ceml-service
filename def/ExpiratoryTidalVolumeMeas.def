ExpiratoryTidalVolumeMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer" in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm."
In the ExpiratoryTidalVolumeMeas model the question is "What is the Expiratory Tidal Volume?" and the "answer" in data can be "X L/h."
ExpiratoryTidalVolume by definition is the volume of gas expired during one ventilator ventilatory cycle.
