OxygenSaturationSensorDescription is intended to describe the type of sensor used by a device, 
        	such as what kind of oximeter probe is used.  It is for a general description of the sensor, 
        	such as "sticky probe" or "ear probe" or "finger probe", not an enumeration of any kind of
        	serial number, device identifier, manufacturer or other specific instance information.  It could also
        	be used to describe any kind of sensor where that general description would be clinically useful.
