MuscleToneEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the MuscleToneEval model, the question is "what is the subject's muscle tone?" and the coded answers can be "Flaccid", "Hypertonic", "Hypotonic", and "Jittery" etc.
"Muscle tone" by definition means "A balanced tension in muscle tissue".
