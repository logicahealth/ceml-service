WeberTestEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the WeberTestEval model, the question is "what are the findings from performing a Weber test?" and the coded answers can be "lateralizes sound" or "Sound perceived in midline". "WeberTest" tests if a patient has conductive hearing loss, or sensorineural hearing loss. A tuning fork is held midline on the patients head. Normal results are to hear the sound centrally and not for sound to be heard better in one ear over another.
