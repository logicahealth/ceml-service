DDimerInterpretation is a model used to store a qualitative description of a D-Dimer result. For example, a clinican or decision support system analyzes the result 
report by the lab and puts that result in the bucket of positive or negative. 
This model was made specifically for the Homer Warner center for use in the pulomonary embolism (PE) clinical decision support application.
