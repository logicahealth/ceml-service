OrderJustification is a component model.
Order Justification lists any required items to explain the "why's" of the order.
This is not a semantic link because the justification is made at the time of the order by the practitioner and alterable by the practictioner.
Billing may use this justification, but billing cannot create this justification.  Any justification created in the billing use cases will 
need to be of a different structure.
	Current values for the key domain are:  Diagnosis, Signs and Symptoms, ?Health Issue.
Action in the application will be:   A practictioner may choose justification from a list or from the problem list of the patient.  If the practictioner
chooses a problem from a list then the application will ask:  do you want to add this to the patient's problem list?  If yes then the problem will be 
create in a model structure, if no then the ecid for the Health Issue will be stored.  Because the Health Issue domain is not sub categorized we perform the
categorization of the health issue via the key domain chosen.  This way the order application and the data mining efforts can find what kind of thing this is being
used as.  Kind of a role.
The "otherwise error" line exists because this model is meant for application use and should have an expectation of what is allowed.
