FetalHeartRateMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the FetalHeartRateMeas model,  the question is "what is the subject's fetal heart rate measure?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Fetal heart rate measure" by definition means "The measurement of the rapidity at which the fetus' heart is beating."
