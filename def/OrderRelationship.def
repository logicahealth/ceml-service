OrderablesRelationship is a component model.
The values of order model include 1)Simple 2)Or 3)Alternating 4)Then 5)Complex. (The default is ""Simple"").The purpose of OrderModel is to simplify implementation, instead of dealing with the complexity of implementing a string expression. For example, if the order model is Or, then the relationship among all the orderables of this order is OR.
If the clinician wants to get more complex, then the string choice is used for storage of the relationship string created by the clinician (e.g. ""(A and B) or C"")."
