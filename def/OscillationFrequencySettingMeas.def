OscillationFrequencySettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the "OscillationFrequencySettingMeas" model, the question is "what is the subject's oscillation frequency setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Oscillation Frequency Setting" by definition means the high frequency ventilator setting in cycles per second (hertz), used for oscillation or jet ventilation.
