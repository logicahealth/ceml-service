IntubationTubePositionMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the IntubationTubePositionMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's intubation tube position?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure in centimeters.
"Intubation tube position" by definition means "Position or depth of an intubation tube in an airway".
