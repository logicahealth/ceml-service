ExtremityStrengthEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD or CO) answer in data. In the ExtremityStrengthEval model, the question is "What is the patient's extremity strength?" and the coded answers can be 'Contraction felt/seen','Active movement with decreased strength', and 'Moves against gravity', 'Moves against some resistance', 'Full strength', 'At baseline' etc.
