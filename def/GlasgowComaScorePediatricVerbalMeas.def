GlasgowComaScorePediatricVerbalMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the GlasgowComaScorePediatricVerbalMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Glasgow coma score pediatric verbal?" and the answer will have an ordinal value. 
"Glasgow coma score pediatric verbal" by definitions means "An element representing the measurement of the verbal portion of the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Score for patients under 4 years old or who are nonverbal."
