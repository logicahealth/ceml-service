RiseTimeSettingMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm."
In the RiseTimeSettingMeas model, the question is "What is the Rise Time Setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"RiseTimeSettingMeas" by definition is: The rise time % setting allows you to adjust how quickly the ventilator generates inspiratory pressure for pressure-based breaths (that is, spontaneous breaths with PS [including a setting of 0 cmH2O]), PC mandatory, or VC+ breaths. The higher the value of rise time %, the more aggressive (and hence, the more rapid) the rise of inspiratory pressure to the target (which equals PEEP + PI [or PSUPP]).
