ClinicalFindingConstantMeas is a model used to measure a constant that may be used in a calculation. For example, the normal dose for 
a VQ Scan Radiation is 60 mSV. So this model will store VQ Scan Radiation average dose as the key code and 60 as the data.
This model was made specifically for the Homer Warner center for use in the pulomonary embolism (PE) clinical decision support application.
