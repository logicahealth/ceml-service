PatientEducationTypeEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the PatientEducationTypeEval model, the question is, "What type of education did the subject receive?" and the coded answers can be "smoking cessation,"
	"prenatal care," and "nutrition," etc.
"PatientEducationTypeEval" by definition means the type of education provided to patients, such as alcohol education, asthma inhaler use education, etc.
