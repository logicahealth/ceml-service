BreastFeedingTimeIntakeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BreastFeedingTimeIntakeMeas model, the question is "what is the time in minutes that an infant actively breast feeds?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure of minutes. 
It is used to estimate the adequacy of fluid intake of a breastfeeding infant.
