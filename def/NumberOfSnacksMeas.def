NumberOfSnacksMeas created on 28/Jul/2016 13:11 by Jael Lindblom for ABD.

This model measures the number of snacks a person had per day prior to admission. If there is a need in the future for more associated preconditions to be added, the code constraint to Preadmission_CODE should be changed to a valueset constraint.
