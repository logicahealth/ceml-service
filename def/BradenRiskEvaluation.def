BradenRiskEvaluation created on 11/May/2016 09:33
BradenRiskEvaluation is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".  For BradenRiskEvaluation the question is "what is the overall, qualitative risk to the patient based on the Braden Total Score?" and the answers are "No Risk: Total score 19-23", "Mild risk: total score 15-18", Moderate risk: total score 13-14", "High risk: total score 10-12", and "Very high risk: total score 9 or lower".
