FatIntakeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm."
In the FatIntakeMeas model, the question is "What is the subject's fat intake?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure.
