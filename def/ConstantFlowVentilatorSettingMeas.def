ConstantFlowVentilatorSettingMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the ConstantFlowVentilatorSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's constant flow ventilator setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
Constant flow ventilator setting means the setting on a mechanical ventilator for constant flow, typically used on high frequency ventilators.
On a Puritan-Bennett 7200 this is the denominator of the "flow-by" setting.  On the Servo 900C this is "continuous flow".
