MaximumMeanAirwayPressureVentilatorAlarmSettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the MaximumMeanAirwayPressureVentilatorAlarmSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's maximum mean airway pressure ventilator alarm setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Maximum mean airway pressure ventilator alarm setting" by definition means "An alarm setting sensitive to the maximum limit for mean airway pressure".
