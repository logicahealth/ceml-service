BradenScoreMobilityMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the  BradenScoreMobilityMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's  Braden mobility score?" and the answer will be an ordinal value.
