Condition is a coded condition that can be used as a start, stop or give condition
Condition Rule consists of a coded value such as "Temperature" an optional operator such as "greater than" and/or "equal to"
and a Variable that while coded will probably be a REAL or text most of the time.  Such as "101".
The expression term id is assigned so that on the level above this condition (in such models as start condition or stop condition)
the id can be used to fabricate an expression such as (A or B), A and B being the expression ids.
