ApneaAlarmSettingMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the ApneaAlarmSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the setting on the device for apnea?" and the numeric answer will be expressed in seconds. 
"ApneaAlarmSetting" by definition means An alarm setting sensitive to the length of time in seconds that the patient experiences apnea (cessation of breath).
