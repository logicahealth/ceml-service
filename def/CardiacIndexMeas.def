CardiacIndexMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the CardiacIndexMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's cardiac index?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure of L/min/M2. 
Cardia index combines the following measurements when calculating the index: body surface area, stroke volume, heart rate and cardiac output.
