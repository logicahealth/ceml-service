GestationalAgeMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the GestationalAgeMeas model, the question is "What is the subject's gestational age?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Gestational age" by definition means the gestational age of a fetus at a particular point in time.
