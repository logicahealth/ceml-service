NeurologicalExamEval model is an impression model. An impression model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) of "normal", "abnormal" or "unremarkable" in data. For example, in the ExtremityExaminationImp model, the "question" is "What is the impression of the extremity examination?", and the "answer" in data can be "Normal", "Abnormal", or "Unremarkable".
In the NeurologicalExamEval model, the question is "what is the impression of subject's neurological exam?". "Neurological exam" by definition means "A neurological assessment of a patient".
