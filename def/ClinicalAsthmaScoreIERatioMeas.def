ClinicalAsthmaScoreIERatioMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the ClinicalAsthmaScoreIERatioMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's clinical asthma inspiration to expiration ratio score?" and the answer will be an ordinal value.
ClinicalAsthmaScoreIERatioMeas is a model of the element of the clinical asthma score used to assess the ratio of inspiratory (I) to expiratory time (E) in an asthmatic patient.
Values range from 0-3 and correspond as follows: 0(I>E); 1(I=E); 2(I<E)
