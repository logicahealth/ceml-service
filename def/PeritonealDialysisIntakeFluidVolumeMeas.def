PeritonealDialysisIntakeFluidVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the PeritonealDialysisIntakeFluidVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Peritoneal Dialysis Intake Fluid Volume?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"PeritonealDialysisIntakeFluidVolumeMeas" is the volume of Peritoneal (dialysate)Intake

06/21/2016 in discussion it was decided that the constraint on intakeFluidType caused too much confusion. Thus, we simplified the definition of intakeFluidType
