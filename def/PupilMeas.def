PupilMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the PupilMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's pupil size?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"PupilMeas" by definition means the pupil size for the right and left eye.
