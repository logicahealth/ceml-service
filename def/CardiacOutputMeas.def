CardiacOutputMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the CardiacOutputMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's cardiac output?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure of liters per minute. 
Cardiac output is a reflection of the amount of blood pumped by the left or right ventricle per minute. It is a combination of the heart rate and stroke volume measurements of a subject.
