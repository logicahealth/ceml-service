HeadControlEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the HeadControlEvalEval model, the question is "how is the subject able to control their head?" and the coded answers can be 'Good', 'Adequate', and 'Limited'.
"HeadControlEval" by definition means the patient's ability to control the movement and stability of their head.
