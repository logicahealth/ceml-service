EndTidalCarbonDioxideMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer"" in data. 
For example, in the EndTidalCarbonDioxideMeas model the "question" or the "test" is "What is the End Tidal Carbon Dioxide Measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be "X mmHg.""
By definition EndTidalCarbonDioxideMeasurement is the measurement of the level of carbon dioxide at the end of exhalation from the body for a patient on a ventilator.
