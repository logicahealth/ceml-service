The AVPU scale (an acronym from "alert, voice, pain, unresponsive") is a system by which a first aider, EMS, or health care professional can measure and record a patient's responsiveness, indicating their level of consciousness.  The values include: 'alert', 'responds to painful stimuli', 'responds to verbal stimuli', and 'unresponsive'.
