PeripheralPulseEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the PeripheralPulseEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Peripheral Pulse?" and the coded answers can be 'Present', 'Absent', etc.
"PeripheralPulseEval" by definition means the evaluation of peripheral pulse of a subject.
