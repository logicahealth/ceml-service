PresentAtTimeOfEventEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the PresentAtTimeOfEventEval model, the question is "who was Present At Time Of Event?" and the coded answers can be '','', and '' etc.
"PresentAtTimeOfEventEval" by definition means who was present at the time an event occurred.
