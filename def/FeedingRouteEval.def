FeedingRouteEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?" and the "answer" in data can be "White."
In the FeedingRouteEval model, the question is "What is the subject's feeding route?" and the coded answers can be "Orojejeunal tube," "Jejunal feeding tube," "Oral," "Nasogastric tube," "Weighted intestinal tube," "Small gauge bowel feeding tube," "Surgically placed gastrostomy tube," "Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube," and "Orogastric tube."
