InspiratoryExpiratoryRatioSettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the InspiratoryExpiratoryRatioSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's inspiratory expiratory ratio setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Inspiratory expiratory ratio setting" by definitions means "The setting for the Inspiratory/Expiratory ratio".
