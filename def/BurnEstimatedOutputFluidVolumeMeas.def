BurnEstimatedOutputFluidVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BurnEstimatedOutputFluidVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the estimated amount of output fluid from a subject's burn injury?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure of mililiters. 
BurnEstimatedOutputFluidVolumeMeas is a measurement model representing the volume of estimated output fluid from an initial burn injury
