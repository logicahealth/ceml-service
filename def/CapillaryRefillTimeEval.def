CapillaryRefillTimeEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the CapillaryRefillTimeEval model, the question is "what is the subject's capillary refill time?" and the coded answers can be 'Capillary Refill Time 2-3 Seconds','Capillary Refill Time Prolonged'.'
The model describes the time in seconds it takes for normal color to return to a digit, or over the sternum, once blood flow is blocked for a short amount of time.
It is an indicator of the health of a persons blood circulation.
