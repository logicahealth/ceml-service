BurnEstimatedOutputFluidVolumeRateMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BurnEstimatedOutputFluidVolumeRateMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's rate of fluid output from a burn?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure of mL/unit of time like per hour, 24 hours, etc. 
BurnEstimatedOutputFluidVolumeRateMeas is a measurement model representing rate of estimated fluid loss from a burn injury over a period of time (for example 4 hours)
