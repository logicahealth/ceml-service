SpontaneousMinuteVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the SpontaneousMinuteVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Spontaneous Minute Volume?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"SpontaneousMinuteVolumeMeas" by definition means the total volume of gas breathed out in one minute during spontaneous respiration.
