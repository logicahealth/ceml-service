ResponsibleParty is a person or organization that has primary responsibility for the act. The responsible party
		is not necessarily present in an action, but is accountable for the action through the power to delegate, and the duty to review
		actions with the performing actor after the fact. This responsibility may be ethical, legal, contractual, fiscal, or fiduciary 
		in nature.
