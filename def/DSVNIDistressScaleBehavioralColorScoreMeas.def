DSVNIDistressScaleBehavioralColorScoreMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the DSVNIDistressScaleBehavioralColorScoreMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's DSVNI Distress Scale Behavioral Color Score?" and the numeric answer will have coded ordinal value.
