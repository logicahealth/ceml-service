ReasonForVisitEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the ReasonForVisitEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Reason For Visit?" and the coded answers can be 'ASthma exam', 'Follow up', etc.
"ReasonForVisitEval" by definition means the reason which leads to the subject's visit to the clinical setting.
