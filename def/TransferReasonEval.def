TransferReasonEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value
(CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?",
and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the TransferReasonEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Transfer Reason?" and the coded answers can be
'additional treatment', 'additional intervention', etc.
"TransferReasonEval" by definition means the reason for transferring the subject.
