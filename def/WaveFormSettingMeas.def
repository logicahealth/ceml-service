WaveFormSettingMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value
(PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?",
and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the WaveFormSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Wave Form Setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"WaveFormSettingMeas" by definition means a setting on a ventilator for a specific wave form.
