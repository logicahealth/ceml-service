TransferredToOtherFacilityEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value
(CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the
"answer" in data can be "White".
In the TransferredToOtherFacilityEval model, the question is, "What facility was the subject transferred to?" and the coded answers
can be "LDS Hospital," "Intermountain Medical Center," etc.
"TransferredToOtherFacilityEval" by definition means the facility where the subject was transferred to.
