CardiacRhythmEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the CardiacRhythmEval model, the question is "what is the subject's cardiac rhythm?" and the coded answers can be 'regular','irregular', etc.
Cardiac Rhythm by definition means the evaluation of the heart rhythm of a subject, which evaluates the cardiac cycle.
