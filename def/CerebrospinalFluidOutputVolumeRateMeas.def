CerebrospinalFluidOutputVolumeRateMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the CerebrospinalFluidOutputVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject rate of cerebral spinal fluid output?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure in mililiters. 
CerebrospinalFluidOutputdVolumeRateMeas is a measurement model representing rate of CerebrospinalFluid output over a specific period of time (for example 4 hours)
