PeritonealDialysisOutputVolumeRateMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the PeritonealDialysisOutputVolumeRateMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Peritoneal Dialysis Output Volume Rate?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"PeritonealDialysisOutputVolumeRateMeas" is the rate of fluid output from a patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis (Ultrafiltrate) over a specific period of time (for example 4 hours)
