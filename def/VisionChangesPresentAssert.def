VisionChangesPresentAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition
being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the VisionChangesPresentAssert model, data is VisionChanges_ECID which means there have been recent vision changes, without
capturing what those vision changes are.
