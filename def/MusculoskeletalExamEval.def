MusculoskeletalExamEval model is an impression model. An impression model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) of "normal", "abnormal" or "unremarkable" in data. For example, in the ExtremityExaminationImp model, the "question" is "What is the impression of the extremity examination?", and the "answer" in data can be "Normal", "Abnormal", or "Unremarkable".
In the MusculoskeletalExamEval model, the question is "what is the impression of subject's musculoskeletal exam?". The exam is generally composed of a serie of examinations, for instance, Crossarm adduction test (drop
            arm), Snuffbox tenderness, etc.
