AdultPeripheralPulseScaleMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the AdultPeripheralPulseScaleMeas model, the question is "what does the subject's peripheral pulse equate to on the adult peripheral pulse scale ?" and the numeric answer will be a CO (1+,2+, etc.) 
"AdultPeripheralPulseScale" by definition is meant to quantify the strength and character of the rhythmic expansion of an 
artery felt peripherally.
