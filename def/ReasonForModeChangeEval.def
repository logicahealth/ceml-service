ReasonForModeChangeEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the ReasonForModeChangeEval model, the question is "what was the Reason For Mode Change?" and the coded answers can be 'Patient transport', 'Per Protocol', etc.
"ReasonForModeChangeEval" is the reason why a mode change was made on a ventilator.
