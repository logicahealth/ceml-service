CalculatedStaticThoracicComplianceMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the CalculatedStaticThoracicComplianceMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's static thoracic compliance?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
Calculated staticn thoracic compliance by definition means the calculated portion of total ventilatory compliance ascribable to compliance of the thoracic cage of patient on ventilator. 
To compute static effective compliance divide the machine corrected tidal volume by the inflation hold pressure (plateau pressure).
