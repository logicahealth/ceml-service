
DiameterSuppressedGrowth model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. 
For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the DiameterSuppressedGrowth model, the question is "what is the sample's Diameter Suppressed Growth?" and the numeric answer will have a numeric value in millimeters. 
Diameter Suppressed Growth captures the measured diameter in millimeters of the suppression of growth by 
an antibiotic drug in a microbiology sample.
