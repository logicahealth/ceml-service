PainRadiation records the body location where the pain is radiating to.  Body location is used as data in this model since it is a component to the
parent model of PainAssert where the body location of the pain is identified.  This data of body location indicates where the pain radiates to (i.e.,
pain in the shoulder radiating to the hand).
