SecondaryFlowRateMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the SecondaryFlowRateMeas model, the question is "what is the Secondary Flow Rate?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"SecondaryFlowRateMeas" by definition means a secondary/additional respiratory gas flow rate.
