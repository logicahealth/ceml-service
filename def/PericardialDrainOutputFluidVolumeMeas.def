PericardialDrainOutputFluidVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the PericardialDrainOutputFluidVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Pericardial Drain Output Fluid Volume?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"PericardialDrainOutputFluidVolumeMeas" is the volume of fluid from a pericardial drain.
