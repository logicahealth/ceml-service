LearningPreferenceEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the LearningPreferenceEval model, the question is "what is the subject's learning preference?" and the coded answers can be "Demonstration", "Printed materials", "Verbal explanation", "Video/Educational TV", "Internet", etc.
"Learning preference" by definition means "The teaching method a person prefers when being taught".
