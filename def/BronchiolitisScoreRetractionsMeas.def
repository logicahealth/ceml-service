BronchiolitisScoreRetractionsMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BronchiolitisScoreRetractionsMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's bronchiolitis retractions score?" and the answer will be an ordinal value.
BronchiolitisScoreRetractionsMeas is model of the element of the bronchiolitis score used to assess severity of respiratory muscle retractions in a  patient.
Values range from 0-3 and corresponds as follows: '0' corresponds to no retractions or 'none', '1' corresponds to retractions in one location, '2' to retractions in two locations, and a '3' to retractions in three or more locations.
