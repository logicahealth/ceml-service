MovementEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the MovementEval model, the question is "what is the subject's movement?" and the coded answers can be "Active movement against resistance", "Active movement with decreased strength", and "Involuntary movement" etc.
"Movement" by definition means "The patient's ability to move".
