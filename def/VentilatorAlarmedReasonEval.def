answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can
be "White".
In the VentilatorAlarmedReasonEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Ventilator Alarmed Reason?" and the coded answer can be
"failed weaning trial," etc.
"VentilatorAlarmedReasonEval" by definition means the explanation of an audible alert or alarm sounded by the ventilator.
