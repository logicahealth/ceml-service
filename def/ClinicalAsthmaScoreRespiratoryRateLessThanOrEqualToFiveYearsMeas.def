ClinicalAsthmaScoreRespiratoryRateLessThanOrEqualToFiveYearsMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the ClinicalAsthmaScoreRespiratoryRateLessThanOrEqualToFiveYearsMeas model, the question is "what is the less than or equal to 5 year old subject's clinical asthma respiratory rate score?" and the answer will be an ordinal value.
ClinicalAsthmaScoreRespiratoryRateLessThanOrEqualToFiveYearsMeas is an element of the clinical asthma score used to assess respiratory rate (RR) in a pediatric patient that is less than or equal to 5 years old.
Values range from 0-2 which correspond as follows: 0(RR<=40); 1(RR 40-60); 2(RR >60)
