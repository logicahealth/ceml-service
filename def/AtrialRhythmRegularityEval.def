AtrialRhythmRegularityEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the AtrialRhythmRegularityEval model, the question is "What's the regularity of the patient's atrial rhythm?" and the coded answers can be 'regular','regularly irregular', and 'irregularly irregular' etc.
