MedicationInfusionDoseRateMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the MedicationInfusionDoseRateMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's medication infusion dose rate?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Medication infusion dose rate" by definitions means "This is the rate at which a medication is administered to a patient, usually via an IV".
