ClinicalAsthmaScoreWheezeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the ClinicalAsthmaScoreWheezeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's clinical asthma wheeze score?" and the answer will be an ordinal value.
ClinicalAsthmaScoreWheezeMeas is model of the element of the clinical asthma score used to assess severity of bronchial wheezing in a patient.
Values range from 0-2 and correspond as follows 0(no wheezing); 1(expiratory only); 2(Inspiratory and expiratory)
