OrientedToPlaceAssert is an assertion model that extends the ClinicalAssertion model by capturing oriented to place-specific data through additional qualifiers. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the OrientedToPlaceAssert model, data is OrientedToPlace_ECID which means "An ability to recognize place." (An indication of a patient's neurological status with regard to place.)
