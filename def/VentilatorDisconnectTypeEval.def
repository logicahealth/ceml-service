VentilatorDisconnectTypeEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD)
answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can
be "White".
In the VentilatorDisconnectTypeEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Ventilator Disconnect Type?" and the coded answers can be
'Disconnection unintended', 'disconnection unkown', etc.
"VentilatorDisconnectTypeEval" by definition means the type of disconnection performed on a ventilator.
