ExposedToCareEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?" and the "answer" in data can be "White."
In the ExposedToCareEval model the question is "what assessments were completed at the time of triage?" and the coded answers can be: "12/15/2011 - no value set has been created [jw])" 
ExposedToCareEval by definition means "12/15/2011 - pending [jw])"
