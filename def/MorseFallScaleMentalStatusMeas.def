The mental status as defined by the Morse Fall Scale.

Mental status: When using this Scale, mental status is measured by checking the patient’s own selfassessment
of his or her own ability to ambulate. Ask the patient, “Are you able to go the bathroom alone
or do you need assistance?” If the patient’s reply judging his or her own ability is consistent with the
ambulatory order on the Kardex®, the patient is rated as “normal” and scored 0. If the patient’s response
is not consistent with the nursing orders or if the patient’s response is unrealistic, then the patient is
considered to overestimate his or her own abilities and to be forgetful of limitations and scored as 15.
