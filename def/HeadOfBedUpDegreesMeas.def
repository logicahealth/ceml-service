HeadOfBedUpDegreesMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the HeadOfBedUpDegreesMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's head of bed up degrees?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Head of bed up degrees" by definitions means "At what angle the head of the bed is raised".
