IVVolume24HrTotalMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the IVVolume24HrTotalMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's IV volume 24 hr total?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"IV volume 24 hr total" by definitions means "The volume of fluid given in 24 hours intravenously".
