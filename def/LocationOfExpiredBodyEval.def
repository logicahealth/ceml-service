LocationOfExpiredBodyEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the LocationOfExpiredBodyEval model, the question is "what is the subject's location of expired body?" and the coded answers can be "Morgue", and "Mortuary" etc.
"Location of expired body" by definition means "A place where an expired body resides", e.g. Morgue, Mortuary.
