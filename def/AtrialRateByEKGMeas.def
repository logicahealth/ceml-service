AtrialRateByEKGMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the AtrialRateByEKGMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's heart rate measured by electrocardiograph?" and the numeric answer will be experessed in beats per minute. 
"AtrialRateByEKG" by definition means the rate of atrial contraction as measured on an EKG (using the distance between P waves).
