FIMScoreBathingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the FIMScoreBathingMeas model,  the question is "what is the subject's FIM score bathing?" and the answer will have an ordinal value. 
"FIM score bathing" by definitions means "A measurement element that records the Functional Independence Measurement score related to a subject's ability to bathe themself".
