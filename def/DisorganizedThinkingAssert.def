DisorganizedThinkingAssert is a clinical assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the DisorganizedThinkingAssert model, data is "DisorganizedThinking_NCID" which means "The subject has disorganized thinking".

Also, the method of the assertion is captured. One of the values can be CAMICUDisorganizedThinkingMeas.
