AerobicExerciseFrequencyMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the AerobicExerciseFrequencyMeas model, the question is "how often does the subject participate in aerobic exercise activity?" and the numeric answer will have a value indicating times per week.
