SpontaneousCorrectedTidalVolumePerWeightMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the SpontaneousCorrectedTidalVolumePerWeightMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Spontaneous Corrected Tidal Volume Per Weight?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"SpontaneousCorrectedTidalVolumePerWeightMeas" by definition means a calculated measurement which applies a value to the tidal volume provided by the subject per kilogram of body weight.
