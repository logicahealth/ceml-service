BodyWeightMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BodyWeightMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's body weight?" and the numeric answer will be expressed in kilograms.  
Calculated body weights (e.g. ideal, goal) will be captured in another model.
