EmesisOutputVolumeMeas is a measurement model that restricts the "OutputVolumeMeas" model (i.e., this model "constrains" the qualifiers in the OutputVolumeMeas" model to emesis output-specific sources, body locations, and methods and devices). A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. 
For example, in the "EmesisOutputVolumeMeas" model the "question" or the "test" is "What measure is the emesis output Volume?" and the "answer" in data can be "X mL."
By definition EmesisOutputVolumeMeas means the measurement of the volume of emesis from a patient
