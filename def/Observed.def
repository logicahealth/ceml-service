Observed is the act of observation.
Observed is a child model of the Attribution model. It holds the who, when, where, and why information
of the observation of an act performed by another entity.
This is used to document that the act was done by someone other than the documenter.
The information is entered by the person doing the documentation -- from the perspective of the person doing the documentation.

Examples:
-- An RN documents that he saw the physician put in the chest tube 
		The entity (person) in the role of RN, participates in the act "chest tube insertion" as observer.
			This information is stored in the "Observed" attribution.
	The entity (person) in the role of MD, participates in the act "chest tube insertion" as primary performer.
    	This information is stored in the "Performed" attribution.
-- An IV was inserted in the operating room.
		 The entity (person) in the role of RN, participates in the act "IV insertion" as receiver in the ICU.
			This information is stored in the "ReportedReceived" attribution.
		 The entity (person) in the role of RN, participates in the act "IV insertion" as reporter in the ICU.
			This information is stored in a second instance of "ReportedReceived" attribution.
		 The entity (person) in the role of "MD", participates in the act of "IV insertion" as primary performer in the OR.
			This information is stored in the "Performed attribution."
		 Only the person who actually watched the IV insertion should document in "Observed".
