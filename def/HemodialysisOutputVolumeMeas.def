HemodialysisOutputVolumeMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the HemodialysisOutputVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's hemodialysis output volume?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Hemodialysis output volume" by definitions means "Volume of Hemodialysis output".
