HeatedWireSettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the HeatedWireSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's heated wire setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Heated wire setting" by definitions means "When a heated-wire ventilator circuit is used, this is the setting that shows the heater temperature relative to the proximal airway temperature.  (-2, -1.5, 0, +1, +2.5, etc)".
