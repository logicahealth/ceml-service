CodedFrequency is a specific named frequency, such as BID, TID, etc. If PeriodicFrequency is instantiated, the value of this field will be "every" or "q=". 
In that case, it is not clear whether choosing "every" as the frequency causes the collection of PeriodicFrequency, or if collection of PeriodicFrequencyLowerLimit
causes an automatic set of this field to "every".
