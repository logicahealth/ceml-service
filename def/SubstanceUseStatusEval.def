SubstanceUseStatusEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value
(CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?",
and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the SubstanceUseStatusEval model, the question is "what is the subject's status of substance use?" and the coded answers
can be 'Past', 'Never', etc.
"SubstanceUseStatusEval" by definition means to determine the status of substance use.
