BarrierToLearningEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the BarrierToLearningEval model, the question is "what are the subject's barriers to learning'?" and the coded answers can be 'language','hearing', and 'vision' etc.
"BarrierToLearning" by definition means "any deficit or reason why the subject may have difficulty learning".
