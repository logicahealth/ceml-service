ApproachSite is a component model used to identify the site through wich a Direct Site is accessed.  For example,
the Cardiac Artery would be the Direct Site that an angioplasty would be performed on and the approach site could
be the Femoral Artery.  Originaly BodyLocation was going to be used for this purpose but was too ambiguous.
ApproachSite has a more explicit meaning in this context.
The ApproachSite value set is the same as the HL7 Body Site value set which derives its values from SNOMED CT
Anatomical Structure (91723000) hierarchy or Acquired body structure (body structure) (280115004) or 
Anatomical site notations for tumor staging (body structure) (258331007) or Body structure, altered from its 
original anatomical structure (morphologic abnormality) (118956008) or Physical anatomical entity 
(body structure) (91722005)
