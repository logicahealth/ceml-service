HIVReferralPanel this is a model for the Family Planning Annual Report that provides 1) A date at which a clinician identifies that a clinical or laboratory finding requires a referral to a different provider for a medical visit related to HIV and 2) the date that the site that found a need for a referral (referrant) receives documentation that the medical visit took place.

A date at which a clinician identifies that a clinical or laboratory finding requires a referral to a different provider for a medical visit and the client has been provided knowledge of that referral. The referred provider and location is summarized as well as any relevant diagnostic or billing codes that help document the need for the referral. This date would be considered the start date for a performance measure that evaluates the time that it takes for a necessary referral period to be completed.

The site that found a need for a referral receives documentation that the medical visit took place and enters the date of that visit. This date would be considered the end date for a performance measure that evaluates the time that it takes for a necessary referral period to be completed.
