EpiduralIntakeFluidVolumeMeas is a measurement model that restricts the IntakeFluidVolumeMeas model (i.e., this model "constrains" the qualifiers in the IntakeFluidVolumeMeas" model to epidural intake-specific body locations, methods and devices and fluid types). A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer" in data. 
For example, in the EpiduralIntakeFluidVolumeMeas model the "question" or the "test" is "What is the Epidural Intake Fluid Volume?" and the "answer" in data can be "X mL."
By definition EpiduralIntakeFluidVolumeMeas means the measurement of the volume of epidural fluid intake.
