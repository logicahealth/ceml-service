WoundDrainOutputFluidVolumeMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds
a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO)  answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate
measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the WoundDrainOutputFluidVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Wound Drain Output Fluid Volume?" and the numeric
answer will have a unit of measure. 
"WoundDrainOutputFluidVolumeMeas" by definition means the volume of fluid draining from a wound.
