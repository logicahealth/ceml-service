AdoptionInfo captures information regarding patient adoption.  Sample values are "Adopted Birth Record" and "Adopted Patient Record".  Business logic
		needs this information to determine access to the record.  If the value is "Adopted Birth Record", the record is for the infant prior to adoption,
		and hence sensitive information may be contained and access is tightly controlled.  If the value is "Adopted Patient Record", the record is
		for the patient after adoption, and its information, along with any information from prior to the adoption is accessible upon an executed
		Release of Information.
