EmesisDescriptionEval is an evaluation model that restricts (i.e., constrains) the FluidDescriptionEval model to emesis-specific fluid description values. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the EmesisDescriptionEval, the question is "what is the description of the emesis fluid?" and the coded answers can be "coffee grounds," "white," and "undigested food."
"EmesisDescription" by definition means the description (characteristics) of emesis.
