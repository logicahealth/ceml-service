TimeOfSnackEval created on 28/Jul/2016 13:34 by Jael Lindblom for ABD.

This model is used to capture the time a snack is eaten prior to admission, like morning, afternoon or evening. If there is a need in the future for more associated preconditions to be added, the code constraint to Preadmission_CODE should be changed to a valueset constraint.
