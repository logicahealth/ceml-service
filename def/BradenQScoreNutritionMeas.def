BradenQScoreNutritionMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BradenQScoreNutritionMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Braden Q nutrition score?" and the answer will be an ordinal value.
