BehaviorFindingsPostEventEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the BehaviorFindingsPostEventEval model, the question is "what behavioral findings did the subject exhibit after an event?" and the coded answers can be 'confused','not responding', and 'combative' etc.
"BehaviorFindingsPostEvent" by definition means " Observed indicators of the mental state of a subject after a procedure or event."
