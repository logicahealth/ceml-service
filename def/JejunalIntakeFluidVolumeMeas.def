JejunalIntakeFluidVolumeMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the JejunalIntakeFluidVolumeMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's jejunal intake volume?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Jejunal intake volume" by definitions means "Volume of Jejunal Intake Fluid"."
