DisconnectSensitivitySettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. 
For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the DisconnectSensitivitySettingMeas model, the question is "what is the ventilator's disconnect sensitivity setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure of percent. 
"DisconnectSensitivitySetting" by definition means "the percentage of returned volume lost, 
above which the ventilator declares a CIRCUIT DISCONNECT alarm."
