EditFormId is a component model.
The "EditFormId" model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer of EditFormId (EditFormId_KEY_ECID) in data.
"EditFormId" by definition means an identifier that is used to link back an order instance with the form to collect/edit the information. Should be a coded value.
