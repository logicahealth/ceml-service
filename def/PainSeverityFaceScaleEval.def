PainSeverityFaceScaleEval model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the PainSeverityFaceScaleEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Pain Severity Face Scale?" and the answer will be a numeric score. 
"PainSeverityFaceScaleEval" by definition means a numeric representation of pain based on facial expressions.
PainSeverityFaceScale is the model for documenting the pain score measured using the Face Scale.
