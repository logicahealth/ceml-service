HeightMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer" in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm."
In the HeightMeas model, the question is "What is the subject's height?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Height" by definitions means "The height of a body."
