AlveolarInfiltrateAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the AlveolarInfiltratessert model, data is AlveolarInfiltrate_ECID which which reflects the presence of areas of the alveoli which are inflammed and/or fluid filled.
