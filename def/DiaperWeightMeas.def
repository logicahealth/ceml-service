DiaperWeightMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. 
For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".

In the DiaperWeightMeas model, the question is "How much does the subject's soiled diaper weigh?" and the numeric answer will be a numeric value expressed in milligrams
