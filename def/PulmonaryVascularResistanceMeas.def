PulmonaryVascularResistanceMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the PulmonaryVascularResistanceMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Pulmonary Vascular Resistance?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"PulmonaryVascularResistanceMeas" by definition means a measurement of the resisitance in the pulmonary vascular bed against which the right ventricle must eject blood.
