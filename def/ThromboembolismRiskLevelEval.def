ThromboembolismRiskLevelEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value
(CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the
"answer" in data can be "White".
In the ThromboembolismRiskLevelEval model, the question is, "What is the subject's Thromboembolism Risk Level?" and the coded answers
can be "high risk," "medium risk," and "low risk."
"ThromboembolismRiskLevelEval" by definition means the subject is at high, medium, or low risk for thromboembolism.  Thromboembolism
is a blood vessel clot.
