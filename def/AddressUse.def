From HL7: "One or more codes advising a system or user which telecommunication address in a set of like addresses to select for a given telecommunication need. The telecommunication use code is not a complete classification for equipment types or locations. Its main purpose is to suggest or discourage the use of a particular telecommunication address. There are no easily defined rules that govern the selection of a telecommunication address."
