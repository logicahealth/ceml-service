VentilationPerfusionScanInterpretation is a model used to store a qualitative description of a Ventilation Perfusion (V/Q Scan). For example, a clinican or natural language processing system analyzes the V/Q 
scan report and interprets that report putting it into one of four categories (High, Intermediate, Low, Negative) 
This model was made specifically for the Homer Warner center for use in the pulomonary embolism (PE) clinical decision support application.
