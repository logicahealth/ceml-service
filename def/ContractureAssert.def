ContractureAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the ContractureAssert model, data is Contracture_ECID which means a permanent shortening of a muscle or joint, usually due to a prolonged hypertonic state.
