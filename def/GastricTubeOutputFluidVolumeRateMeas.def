GastricTubeOutputFluidVolumeRateMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the GastricTubeOutputFluidVolumeRateMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's gastric tube output rate?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Gastric tube output rate" by definitions means "Rate of gastric tube output".
