OralIntakeFluidVolumeMeas is a measurement model that restricts the "IntakeFluidVolumeMeas" model (i.e., this model "constrains" the qualifiers in the IntakeFluidVolumeMeas" model to oral intake-specific body locations, methods and devices and fluid types). A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. 
For example, in the OralIntakeFluidVolumeMeas model the "question" or the "test" is "What is the Orall Intake Fluid Volume?", and the "answer" in data can be "X mL"."
By definition "Oral Intake Fluid Volume Measurement" means the measurement of the volume of Oral Fluid Intake.
