FundalHeightMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the FundalHeightMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's fundal height?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Fundal height" by definition means "A measurement of the uterus to determine fetal growth.  The distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus".
