DSVNIDistressScaleBehavioralBodyMovementScoreMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the DSVNIDistressScaleBehavioralBodyMovementScoreMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's DSVNI Distress Scale Behavioral Body Movement Score?" and the numeric answer will have coded ordinal value. 
DSVNIDistressScaleBehavioralBodyMovementScoreMeas is an element of the DSVNI distress scale used mainly with ventilated newborns, but can be used with a non-ventilated newborn to rate pain/discomfort
		             Values are 0-3, which correspond as follows: 0(relaxed), 1(restless), 2(exaggerated), 3(inert)
