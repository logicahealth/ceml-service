ConsistencyOfStoolEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the ConsistencyOfStoolEval model, the question is "what is the consistency of the subject's stool?" and the coded answers could be from a set such as LA 11029-6 ("Normal", "Soft", "Dry"...)
"ConsistencyOfStoolEval" by definition means a description of the stool consistency.
