IntracranialPressureMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the IntracranialPressureMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's intracranial pressure measure?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Intracranial pressure measure" by definitions means "The measured pressure within the cranial cavity".
