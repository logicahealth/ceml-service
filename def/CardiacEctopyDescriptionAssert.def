CardiacEctopyDescriptionAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the CardiacEctopyDescriptionAssert model, data is chosen from a domain of CardiacEctopyDescription_VALUESET_CODE. Sample values from this value set are 'premature atrial deplorization(s)', 'premature junctional deplorization(s)', and 'premature ventricular deplorization(s)' etc.
This model describes the assertion of the description of the patient's cardiac ectopy.
