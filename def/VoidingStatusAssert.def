VoidingStatusAssert is an assertion model. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the VoidingStatusAssert model, data is VoidingStatus_VALUESET_ECID which means the patient has one of the statuses in the value set.
