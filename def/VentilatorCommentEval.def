VentilatorCommentEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD)
answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer"
in data can be "White".
In the VentilatorCommentEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Ventilator Comment?" and the coded answers can be
'MD notified', 'new airleak', etc.
"VentilatorCommentEval" by definition means any notes or comments entered by the ventilator operator.
