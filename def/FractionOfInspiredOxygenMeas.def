FractionOfInspiredOxygenMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the FractionOfInspiredOxygenMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's fraction of inspired oxygen?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Fraction of inspired oxygen" by definitions means "The fraction of oxygen delivered by any method and inspired by a subject. Recorded as a decimal between 0.21 and 1.0".
