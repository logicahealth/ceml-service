MechanismOfInjuryEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the MechanismOfInjuryEval model, the question is "what is the subject's mechanism of injury?" and the coded answers can be "ATV vehicle accident", "Animal", and "Auto/Bike accident" etc.
"Mechanism of injury" by definition means "The manner in which one was injured".
