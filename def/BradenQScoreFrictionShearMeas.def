BradenQScoreFrictionShearMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the BradenQScoreActivityMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's Braden Q friction/shear score?" and the answer will be an ordinal value from: '1'corresponds to 'Significant Problem' with friction and shear, '2' corresponds to 'Problem','3' to 'Potential Problem', '4' to 'No apparent problem'.
"The BradenQ Friction/Shear Score" is an element of the bradenQ score skin assessment tool. his section evaluates the newborn/pediatric patient's risk for skin friction and shear.
