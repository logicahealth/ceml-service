CAM_ICU_deliriumPanel models the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) score for use in ICU patients (see below). 
Note: AlteredMentalStatusAssert and FluctuatingMentalStatusAssert are constrained in likelihood to Definitely not (NCID:522884096)
and Definitely (NCID:522884100) to reflect presence and absence. 
Note: DataAbsentReason is being constrained to approriate CAM_ICU_evalExclusions such as "Non-English Speaking', 'Blind', 'Extremely hard of hearing', Severe mental diability (e.g. Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy...), Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score of '-4' or '-5', 'Refused', 'Withdrawal of support.'

Sedation and Delirium Assessments:
A Two Step Approach
Step One: Sedation Assessment(RASS)
If RASS is -4or -5, then Stop & Reassess patient at later time
If RASS is above-4 (-3 through +4) then Proceed to Step 2
Step Two: Delirium Assessment (CAM-ICU)
Feature 1: Acute onset of mental status changes
or a fluctuating course
And
Feature 2: Inattention
And
Feature 3: DisorganizedOr Feature 4: Altered
Thinking Level of Consciousness
