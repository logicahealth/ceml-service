OxygenSaturationArterialBloodPulseOximeterMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the "OxygenSaturationArterialBloodPulseOximeterMeas" model the question is "what is the subject's Oxygen Saturation Arterial Blood Measurement?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
Oxygen Saturation Arterial Blood Measurement by definition means a subject's (arterial) oxygen saturation in a clinical, not laboratory setting, via pulse oximetry.
