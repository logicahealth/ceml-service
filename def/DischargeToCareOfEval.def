DischargeToCareOfEval is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the DischargeToCareOfEval model, the question is "into who's care was the patient discharged?" and the coded answers can be 'mother,' 'father,' etc.
"DischargeToCareOfEval" by definition is the party responsible for caring for the subject following discharge.
