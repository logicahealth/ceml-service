TobaccoUseStatusEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value
(CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?",
and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the TobaccoUseStatusEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Tobacco Use Status?" and the coded answers can be
'Former tobacco user; quit more than 1 year ago','Patient has never used tobacco products', etc.
"TobaccoUseStatusEval" by definition means the status of the subjects current tobacco usage.
