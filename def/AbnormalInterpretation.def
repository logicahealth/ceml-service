AbnormalInterpretation takes a value from the valueset listed in the model to indicate the data value in the containing model is "abnormal".
      This model is used to constrain values from OBX-8 in a lab result HL7 message. 
       Because OBX-8 is overloaded to contain multiple types of data, we need a way to tell
       which kind of code is sent (abnormal flag, delta flag, or ordinal interpretation).

Sample values from AbnormalInterpretation_VALUESET_ECID
		Below low normal
		Very abnormal
		Above absolute high-off instrument scale
		Below lower panic limits
		Abnormal
		Above upper panic limits
		Above high normal
		Below absolute low-off instrument scale
