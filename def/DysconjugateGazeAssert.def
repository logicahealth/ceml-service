DysconjugateGazeAssert is an assertion model that extends the ClinicalAssertion model by capturing Dysconjugate Gaze-specific data through additional qualifiers. In an assertion model, the key is set to "Assertion_KEY_ECID", and data is the condition being asserted. 
For example, the AbdominalTendernessAssert model has a key of "Assertion_KEY_ECID" and a data of "AbdominalTenderness_ECID".
In the DysconjugateGazeAssert model, data is DysconjugateGaze_ECID.   
By definition DysconjugateGazeAssert asserts the existence of Dysconjugate Gaze, or the failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction.
