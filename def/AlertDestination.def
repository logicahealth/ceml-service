AlertDestination indicates to whom, where, how, and when an alert is sent 
(e.g., John Smith, pager). AlertDestination can be categorized into two kinds: 
1) General destination (destinationType).
General destination has values such as ordering physician, calling program, specific user, attending physician, 
attending nurse, bedside nurse, bedside terminal, department, nursing division, tracking board, printer nearest 
patient, specific printer, alert table, patient CDR, JMS queue, table, process. 
2) Specific destination (specific instances), which is string. In the case where the 
alert is stored in CDR, specific destination is not required and its cardality can be 0. For the same reason, 
no deliverymethod is needed when it is stored in CDR.
