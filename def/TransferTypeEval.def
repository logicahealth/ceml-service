TransferTypeEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value
(CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?",
and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the TransferTypeEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Transfer Type?" and the coded answers can be 'medical','trauma', etc.
"TransferTypeEval" by definition means the type of the transfer of a patient.
