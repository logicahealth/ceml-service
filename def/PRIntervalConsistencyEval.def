PRIntervalConsistencyEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the PRIntervalConsistencyEval model, the question is "What's the consistency of the patient's PR Interval?" and the coded answers can be 'consistent', 'inconsistent', 'Progressively lengthening', and 'Intermittent non-conducted P-wave' etc.
