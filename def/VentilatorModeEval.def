VentilatorModeEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD)
answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer"
in data can be "White".
In the VentilatorModeEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Ventilator Mode?" and the coded answers can be
'volume assisted', 'pressure support', etc.
"VentilatorModeEval" by definition means the mode or type of ventilation being administered to the patient.
