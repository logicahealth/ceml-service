ColorOfStoolEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the ColorOfStoolEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Stool color?" and the coded answers can be 'black', 'blood, Frank', etc. based on LOINC value sets
"ColorOfStoolEval" by definition means a description of the stool characteristics.
