TransferLocationEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value
(CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?",
and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the TransferLocationEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Transfer Location?" and the coded answers can be
'Psych facility', 'Burn center', etc.
"TransferLocationEval" by definition means where the patient was transferred to.
