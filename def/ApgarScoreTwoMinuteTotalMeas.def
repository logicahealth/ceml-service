ApgarScoreTwoMinuteTotalMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ)or ordinal value (CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm"
In the ApgarScoreTwoMinuteTotalMeas model, the question is "what is the newborn's Total Apgar score 2 minutes after birth?" and the numeric answer will be PQ refecting the total of the ordinal values captured in the ApgarScoreTwoMinuteActivityMeas, ApgarScoreTwoMinuteAppearanceMeas, ApgarScoreTwoMinuteGrimaceMeas, ApgarScoreTwoMinutePulseMeas, ApgarScoreTwoMinuteRespirationMeas models. Values can range from 0-10.
