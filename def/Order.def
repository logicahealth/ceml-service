OrderContainer is a component model.
The Order Container segments (there can be more than one) represent orders within the Order with a specific relationship as defined in the OrderModel.
Expression field. An example is an alternating infusion order where the alternating infusion bottles are each defined in a 
separate Order Container and the relationship between the infusion bottle Order Container is defined in the OrderModel.Expression. In the vast majority of orders, there will only be one Order Container. 
The Order node serves as a container for multiple Order containers, or, in the traditional sense, multiple orders. 
In the vast majority of orders, such a container would be unnecessary as most orders are not complex. 
Most order systems fail, however, by their inability to express complex orders.
