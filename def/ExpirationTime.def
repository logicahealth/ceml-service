ExpirationTime model is a component model. 
The ExpirationTime model holds a "question" in the key and a Time Stamp (TS) as the answer in data.  
In the ExpirationTime model the question is "when does this expire?" and the answer in data is a time stamp value.
Expiration Time by definition means the date and time (if needed) that something expires, i.e. expiration time of credentials.
