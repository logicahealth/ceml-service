CervicalConsistencyEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the CervicalConsistencyEval model, the question is "what is the consistency of a women's cervix'?" and the coded answers can be 'thick','mucoid', and 'watery' etc.
Cervical Consistency by definition identifies the cervical consistency in the subject usually related to a stage of pregnancy or labor.
