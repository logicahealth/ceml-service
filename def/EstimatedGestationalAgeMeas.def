EstimatedGestationalAgeMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) "answer" in data. 
For example, in the EstimatedGestationalAgeMeas model the "question" or the "test" is "What is the Estimated Gestational Age?" and the "answer" in data can be "X weeks."
EstimatedGestationalAgeMeas by definition means the estimated gestational age.
