OdorType is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the OdorEval model, the question is "what is the Odor?" and the coded answers can be 'Musty','Odorless', and 'Ketone' etc.
"Odor evaluation" by definition means a description of the smell of something.
