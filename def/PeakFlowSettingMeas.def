PeakFlowSettingMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the PeakFlowSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the Peak Flow Setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"PeakFlowSettingMeas" by definition means the ventilator setting for peak flow.
