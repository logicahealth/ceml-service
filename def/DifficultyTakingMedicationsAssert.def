DifficultyTakingMedicationsAssert created on 01/Jul/2016 09:46 by Jael Lindblom for ABD.

This model is used to assert that a patient has difficulty taking medications prior to admission. If there is a need in the future for more associated preconditions to be added, the code constraint to Preadmission_CODE should be changed to a valueset constraint.
