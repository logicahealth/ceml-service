ExpiredCorrectedMachineTidalVolumeMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?" and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm."
In the ExpiredCorrectedMachineTidalVolumeMeas model the question is "What is the expired corrected machine tidal volume?" and the "answer" in data can be "X L/min."
By definition Expired Corrected Machine Tidal Volume is a calculated number resulting from the following formula: emctv =ExpVt-[(PEAK-PEEP)COMP)] where emctv is expired machine corrected tidal volume.
