IntubationTubeCuffPressureMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the IntubationTubeCuffPressureMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's intubation tube cuff pressure?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Intubation tube cuff pressure" by definitions means "A measurement of an artificial airway tube pressure used to inflate an available cuff to prevent air leakage, and hold tube in place".
