PsychExamEval model is an impression model. An impression model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) of "normal", "abnormal" or "unremarkable" in data. For example, in the ExtremityExaminationImp model, the "question" is "What is the impression of the extremity examination?", and the "answer" in data can be "Normal", "Abnormal", or "Unremarkable".
In the PsychExamEval model, the question is "what is the impression of subject's Psych Exam?" and the coded answer can be "Normal", "Abnormal", or "Unremarkable".
"PsychExamEval" by definition means evalutating the subject's current psychological state for normalcy.
