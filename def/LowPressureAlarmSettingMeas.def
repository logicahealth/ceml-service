LowPressureAlarmSettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the LowPressureAlarmSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's low pressure alarm setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Low pressure alarm setting" by definitions means "An alarm setting sensitive to undesirable levels of low pressure".
