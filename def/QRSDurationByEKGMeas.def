QRSDurationByEKGMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the QRSDurationByEKGMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's QRS Duration By EKG?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"QRSDurationByEKGMeas" measures the duration of the QRS complex on an EKG.  It is equivalent to LOINC QRSDurationTimePatientHeartEkg.
