AlcoholUseStatusEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD or CO) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the AlcoholUseStatusEval model, the question is "What is the status of a subject's use of alcohol?" and the coded answers can be 'never used alcohol', etc.
