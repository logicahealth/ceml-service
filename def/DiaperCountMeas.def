DiaperCountMeas model is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ) answer in data. 
For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the DiaperCountMeas model, the question is "How many soiled diapers has the subject produced?" and the numeric answer will be without units of measure.
