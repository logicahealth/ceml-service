Confidentiality model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the Confidentiality model, the question is "what is the subject's confidentiality type?" and the coded answers can be 'Sexual and domestic violence confidential level','Restricted confidential level', and 'Normal confidential level' etc.
Confidentiality by definition means the control surrounding the disclosure of information about this patient encounter.
