InspiratoryPauseSecondsSettingMeas is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a "question" or a "test" in the key and holds a numeric value (PQ, IVLPQ, REAL, INT, CO) answer in data. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the "question" or the "test" is "What is the heart rate measurement?", and the "answer" in data can be "100 bpm".
In the InspiratoryPauseSecondsSettingMeas model, the question is "what is the subject's inspiratory pause seconds setting?" and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. 
"Inspiratory pause seconds setting" by definitions means "Setting for pause between inspirations in seconds".
