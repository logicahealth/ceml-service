RespiratoryTherapyObjectiveEval model is an evaluation model. An evaluation model holds a "question" in the key and holds a coded value (CD) answer in data. For example, in the HairColorEval model, the "question" is "What is the hair color evaluation?", and the "answer" in data can be "White".
In the RespiratoryTherapyObjectiveEval model, the question is "what is the subject's Respiratory Therapy Objective?" and the coded answers can be 'Airway humidification', 'Wean from Oxygen', etc.
"RespiratoryTherapyObjectiveEval" by definition means the goals that the respiratory therapy should accomplish.
